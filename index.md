White Rabbit Fiber Arts first began in 2020 shortly after the vernal equinox when I first brought home my pair of Giant Angora Rabbits; Poppy and Clover, the inspiration and namesake of this shop.
My goal is to create authentic art that helps rekindle a connection to nature. I work exclusively with natural fibers like cotton and my own hand spun yarn from 100% wool sourced from small, local farms. It's so personal that I know the name of almost every sheep whose beautiful fiber I have had the pleasure to work with. I also source my own angora wool from my well loved bunnies and the entire process from wool to textile is done by me right here at home.

I find an abundance of beauty in the natural world that is hard to replicate synthetically so I choose to work with un-dyed fibers and create with the natural pallet of the color variations of wool or create my own natural botanical dyes for living plant color.

My work is a practice in patience and a labor of love and the result of many hours spent tending my sweet animals, spinning yarn at my wheel, stirring a botanical dye pot, and weaving on one of my many looms and I love every step of the process.
Thank you for supporting my shop,
