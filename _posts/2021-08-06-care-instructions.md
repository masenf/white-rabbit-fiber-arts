I’m a big believer in **"if it’s handmade; hand wash it"** with the exception of utilitarian items such as towels.

<span class="inline-title">Natural Dyes- </span>I use an alum mordant in my dye process and work primarily with tannin
rich plants to ensure color and light fastness. However, like most dyes, these may fade with prolonged exposure to direct
sunlight and frequent laundering. I recommend gentle handwashing with mild detergent only as necessary.

<span class="inline-title">Wool/Angora- </span>A wonderful fiber, wool readily releases stains and often a soak in
tepid water is all that is needed. Gentle handwashing with a wool wash is also acceptable as needed. Avoid agitation
to prevent unwanted felting. Gently squeeze out excess water, do not wring. Lay flat to dry. Ironing not recommended. 

<span class="inline-title">Cotton/Linen- </span>Items made exclusively with these cellulose fibers may be laundered on
a delicate cycle, though handwashing is recommended. May be ironed on cotton setting.
