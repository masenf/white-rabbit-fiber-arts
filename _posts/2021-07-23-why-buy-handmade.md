title: Why Buy Handmade?
---

When I began my journey into a handwoven business one of the initial hurdles I recognized was that much of my
handwoven work and their subsequent price tags would be compared to mass manufactured items on the shelves of big box
stores. It was a little discouraging to see some of the reactions over my prices and I racked my brain for ways that I
could attempt to lower my costs without compromising my own value systems when it dawned on me that my work would never
be able to compete with those prices and that I could not compare my handmade work to mass produced products because
they are entirely different things and the similarities begin and end on the surface level.

# When choosing handmade you are:

<span class="inline-title">Buying a piece of art. </span>It’s unlikely that you will find the same runner in your
friend’s kitchen as the one adorning your own table. Handwoven items are unique and special and not just another
mass-produced item with a SKU and barcode, it’s your own piece of functional art. It can imbue artistic expression and
creativity into your daily living and become a cherished heirloom. Hand weaving also makes possible many finger
controlled weaving techniques that cannot be recreated by machines (yet)
that require artisanal finesse.

<span class="inline-title">Choosing sustainability for people and the planet. </span>It’s no secret that capitalism has
led to major corruption and exploitation in the textile industry; currently one of the top polluting industries in the
world. Big corporations minimize cost to achieve maximum profit and it’s the people at the bottom doing the labor that
receive the smallest piece of the pie. In buying handmade you are fairly compensating the artisan for their work. Buying
from small businesses can also drastically reduce waste and often when things are handmade they are created to last.

<span class="inline-title">Keeping traditional skills and knowledge alive. </span> Weaving is an ancient craft, from
back strap looms to humble frame looms, rigid heddles and floor looms the roots of weaving run deep. In a time and place
where we so heavily rely on electricity, computers and fossil fuels to do the work for us, it’s important to remember
the thousands of years of human ingenuity and creativity that got us to this point and it is the artisan that keeps
these humble yet vital skills alive.

<span class="inline-title">Buying an item with a soul and a story. </span>One of my favorite things about hand weaving
is that it is my own life force energy that powers the loom and creates the finished textile. I have the ability to
weave a beautiful cloth with absolutely no electricity or fossil fuels and that self-reliance in a closed loop creation
produces a palpable quality in the textile. You can all but feel and see the time, energy, emotion, heart and soul that
went into turning humble threads into a tangible cloth you can hold in your hands.

Undoubtedly, mass-production and industrialization have improved the standard of living across the world to the point
where handmade goods are considered a luxury item. I am aware of how uneven distribution of wealth and resources have
made the ability to choose handmade a privilege. I understand that many of us don’t have even the luxury of time to
ponder these issues as we make ends-meat to support our families and I pass zero judgement. I implore you only if able,
to consider where your products are coming from and if you do have the choice between mass produced and handmade to
choose the artisan over the factory.
