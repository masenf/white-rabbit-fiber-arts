title: Fall at the Fiber Farm
---

It's Virgo season, the unofficial start of autumn, and I am relieved. It's been a busy summer and record high temps in
the triple digits here in the PNW have made caring for the angoras a challenge. Between a borrowed industrial fan,
frozen water bottles, shearing ahead of schedule and on the hottest day, moving Huckleberry into the bathroom; we made
it through. The cooler temps are a welcomed reprieve for all at the tiny fiber farm.

This season I am looking forward to switching it up a bit and working on some warm and cozy seasonal weavings in classic
twills and earthy autumnal colors created from rosemary, coffee grounds, black walnut, and madder reds. I will be adding
more options for festive plaid table runners and centerpieces as well as working up some dish cloths and kitchen towels.
I love the idea of fusing the functional, ordinary items we use everyday with a touch of handcrafted magic from my loom
to your kitchen, the heart of the home.

I'm also looking forward to slowing down and enjoying the darkening days at my spinning wheel with a warm cup of coffee
and a basket of roving. I have plans to restock coasters, weave some houseplant sized rugs and include some more wall
hangings. However, my main goal for all that wonderfully warm wool is to bring my daydreams of cozy, oversized, chunky
cowl scarves to life.

Fall truly is my favorite time of the year and such an inspiring season for a fiber artist. I am so grateful to be
spending it creating warm and cozy textiles for my home and yours.
